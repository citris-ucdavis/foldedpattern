The Folded Pattern puzzle, built on the Visual Thinking `RelatedObjects` puzzle template, presents the player with four folded boxes and a flat 2D pattern representing an unfolded box. It challenges the player to visually determine which of the four folded boxes could possibly be the result of folding the unfolded box pattern such that its white and black coloring faces outward. If the player has difficulty determining this by visual inspection alone, each box may be picked up, examined, rotated, and placed back down in order to assist the player in solving the puzzle.
